	<p><span>The recesion is</span> so oh-vah. It is yesterday's news, last quarter's buzzkill, history's hangover. And it is, finally, finito. How do I know this? I read it in the (boring) business section, and saw it in the barely contained grins of Obama advisers. Also I went to Uniqlo the other day and was nearly trampled alive in the men's department. Dozens of rampaging shoppers, their pent-up consumptive energies suddenly released as from the very Dam of Desire, all tried to grab the same plaid shirt. I held on to a corner of the sleeve, only to have the thing collared and ripped from my hands by a brute twice my neck size. I was hungry</p>

	<p>for plaid, but not that hungry. I let it go, brushed myself off, thanked everyone in that crowd for regaining their consumer confidence, and quietly walked out into the recession-free air.</p>
	<p>I don't really know how these things - how the ends of economic eras-get officially declared. I wouldn't bother asking an economist. They know nothing, and like badgers, they do not like being cornered. Do you remember, about two and a half years ago, when we all knew in our guts that we were in the sort of deep $#!% you might call a recession, how economists refused to say the obvious because the obvious hadn't been approved by them yet? You'd be flat broke, unable to fill up the ol' Hummer, only to turn on your radio and hear the drone of their forecasts: <i>An increasing number of economists increasingly believe we may increasingly already be in, or may soon be heading into, a recession...</i></p>
	<p>And then, a few months later, while you were busy selling the last of your worldly goods, you'd tune in again, and there they'd be, acting like they knew it all along.</p>
	<p>Economists now believe we have been in a recession for a full year or perhaps longer...</p>
	<p>WTF? How do they get to have it both ways? And why is it that they always get the last word? They get to define economic reality for us and yet can only speak of that reality in hedged, mysterious terms. If you ask an economist to define a recession, he'll say, "That's easy. It is two successive quarters of my saying things are really awful out there." Okay, so when's it over? "That's even easier. When I say it is."</p>
	<p>I feel like someone anointed them with special oils and granted them dominion over our senses, and that this someone was almost certainly Alan Greenspan. Now they exert a mesmeric, Oz-like control over our lives-they even tell us when we have confidence!-and yet are unaccountable for such things as speaking gibberish or being terribly, terribly wrong. Shouldn't there be a reality show in which, one by one, we vote them off this great island of ours? That would be an amazing show if no one had to watch it.</p>
	<p>Me, I don't believe a word they say and yet constantly fall prey to their statistical voodoo. Last summer, when the rest of you were living off the volcanic ash of your 401(k)s, Newsweek ran a big story, excitedly declaring the recession over, or maybe sort of, and citing a sexy, sexy organization called the Economic Cycle Research Institute. Hey, these guys were cool. "They're the Spocks of the economic forecasting crowd." Grrrrowl. My economic indicators pointed up. And so did their pointy-eared prognostications. They cited the three P's: pronounced, persistent, and pervasive rises in the leading economic indicators, allowing Newsweek to semi-gush that the recession "may already be over."</p>
	<p>MAY be? I thought: Guys, you are not helping with the may or the already. We are not interested in the subjunctive. The recession is either over or it's bumming us out. Give me my consumer confidence back! So I kept searching for signs. I shopped when others dared not. I dined out in empty restaurants. I watched CNBC until the news crawl started speaking to me in evil tongues. I started to lose faith in all economy</p>
	<p>Wait, wait. This just in... Dateline: April 12, 2010. The National Bureau of Economic Research would like to say something. Okay, this is the big announcement. And these guys are the cr&egrave;me de la economic cr&egrave;me. Whatever they say is golden. They have been studying the all-important "trough data," which they would very much like not to have to explain. (It's complicated.) I believe it works like this: They study charts, peaks, dips, valleys (because someone must) and look for algorithmic signs that we can all start partying again.</p>
	<p>So is it over? A full year after Newsweek and the Spock dudes said it was?</p>
	<p>I'm sorry. The National Bureau of Tightwads regrets to inform you that "although most indicators have turned up," any announcement that the recession is over "would be premature." Please stand by for further announcements.</p>
	<p>Don't believe them or their silly little trough data. Ever again. Trust my gut. It's over.</p>
